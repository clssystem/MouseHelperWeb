      Having trouble moving the mouse pointer?


      Make the mouse adapt to you, and not the other way around!
    

      * Easily increase or decrease mouse speed under normal conditions.

      * Set another speed when pressing the Ctrl or Alt keys to work as a throttle or a brake
      
      * If you still cannot control the mouse and it shakes too much, you can soften the movement by selecting the resistance to movement

      Are you having trouble clicking the mouse buttons?


      * Choose the button or buttons that give you problems.
      
      * Select the minimum time you must press and hold the button for it to generate a click.

      * And finally select the speed of the double click.
