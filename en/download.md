          Download the setup file and follow the instructions, depending on your
          internet browser


          If you have problems installing it (because your antivirus prevents
          it, for example), try the following:

          * Please disable your antivirus (or add an exception for
          MouseHelper.exe), try the download and installation again, and then
          turn your antivirus back on
              
            The program is digitally signed by me, and has all the guarantees, but since it accesses the mouse and keyboard at a very low level, some antivirus can incorrectly detect it as a false positive
            As far as possible I will be contacting these companies so that they take it into account

          * If you can't, choose the ZIP file method


          * If you continue to have problems, contact me by email at
          <a href='&#109;ai&#108;t&#111;&#58;&#37;6D&#111;usehe&#108;%70e&#114;&#64;outlo&#111;&#107;%&#50;Ee&#115;'>&#109;&#111;u&#115;ehe&#108;&#112;er&#64;outlook&#46;&#101;s</a> and I will
          try to help you personally
             
          **Keep in mind that I offer my help altruistically, and that behind
          this project I am only dedicating my free time, so be patient**
